            Cecile-Anne Sison (Cecile) is student programmer living in Chicago.
            Currently the Instructional Technology Lead of the
            <a href="http://web.madstudio.northwestern.edu/"
              >Media and Design Studio</a
            >
            at Northwestern University, she supports course enhancement for
            Undergraduate Humanities classes by creating digital projects and
            deploying digital tools. Her main interests lie in incorporating
            game design and game play into pedagogy. She hopes to develop tools,
            sites and software that can be used in academia.
          </p>

            Cecile's career has been a marriage of technical and visually
            creative endeavors, which is why coding seemed like the next logical
            step in her evolution. After living in Canada, Hong Kong and the
            Philippines, Cecile received her BS in Communication from
            Northwestern University with a major in Radio/Television/Film
            (focused on producing and cinematography). Her production experience
            includes a gamut of duties at various levels (student, studio and
            independent), including leading hundred-person crews. These projects
            have honed her problem solving and collaborative skills. After
            college she spent many years working for the Mellon International
            Dunhuang Archive (housed on ARTstor) as both a member of the
            photography team on location in China and as a scholar/metadata
            specialist. Having lived and worked all over the world, she is
            mindful and open to other points of view. Other interests include
            travel, throwing theme parties, Pokemon Go, archery and finding new
            projects to collaborate on. She is eager to learn!
